This is a website where clients can book a barber for them or buy the various clippers we have in stock

brainstorming my approach:
    backend:

    find pictures of clippers, barbers, and find images of cut hair with a description on those specific cuts.

    send them in the db with their contact info.
    
    frontend: 

    home screen page.

    navbar for clippers and barbers with their clients cuts on display and appointement availablities.

    ability to rate the barbers and or leave a review if the client has been with the barber.

    for barbers there is going to be a code in the search bar to put so they can acess the admin section of the site
     where they can add more clippers to their supply in the db or do other things
